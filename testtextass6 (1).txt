The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy log! It was crazy! I wonder what the quick brown fox will do next...
What color is the fox? Is it brown? Is it red? No! It is orange! Wow! What does the fox say? No one seems to 
know. Darn. Whose is it? Is it Chris's fox? Is it Om's fox? We will never know, because the fox does not have
a collar. Oh well. We shall let this fox run free. Run little fox! Run! Run! Hopefully this fox isn't badly affected
by global warming. Global warming is really bad.
